# Manufacting-Analytics
This project aimed to analyze and optimize the manufacturing process by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) related to production efficiency, rejection rates, and employee productivity.
SQL:  Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation from raw manufacturing datasets. Created optimized queries and aggregate views to prepare analysis-ready tables.
Tableau: Developed interactive dashboards for initial data exploration and visualization of trends such as production volume, defect rates, and material utilization.
 Power BI:  Built detailed analytical dashboards to evaluate employee-wise productivity, rejection percentage, and repeat orders. Created DAX measures for KPIs like Total Manufactured Quantity, Employee Productivity, and Rejection %. Integrated slicers and filters for dynamic analysis.
Outcome: Provided actionable insights to improve process efficiency, monitor employee performance, and reduce rejection rates. The visual dashboards supported data-driven decision-making across production teams.
